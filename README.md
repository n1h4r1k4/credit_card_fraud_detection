# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning**.  
It leverages **Logistic Regression**, a supervised classification algorithm, to identify whether a transaction is **legitimate (0)** or **fraudulent (1)** based on various anonymized features.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… **Data Preprocessing:** Handles scaling and splitting of data.  
âœ… **Model Training:** Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification.  
âœ… **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.  
âœ… **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Stratified splitting maintains class ratio.  
âœ… **Sample Testing:** Predicts whether a random transaction is Fraud or Not Fraud.  
âœ… **Easily Extendable:** Can be enhanced with advanced algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
